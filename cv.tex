\section{Experience}

\subsection{GoCardless}
\begin{cventry}{\orange{Apr~2024}}{Senior Software Development Engineer}
  \begin{tightitemize}
  \item Upskilled developers by organising sessions on alerting, runbooks, and incident response.
  \item Led discovery and development of a ``multi-account'' system, to support large merchants.
  \end{tightitemize}
\end{cventry}

\begin{cventry}{\range{Mar~2022}{Apr~2024}}{Software Development Engineer}
  \begin{tightitemize}
  \item Designed a replacement scheduler for kubernetes cronjobs to gracefully handle daylight savings and other timezone changes.
  \item Led a project to localise our daily batch-processing pipelines to optimise timings with international banking partners.
  \item Implemented an MVP of using machine learning to speed up payment processing where there is low risk of failure, and joined customer calls to discuss their needs.
  \item Analysed and improved the performance of time-sensitive data processing pipelines through table partitioning and algorithmic improvements.
  \item Led tabletop sessions for team members to discuss potential incidents and identify mitigations.
  \item Mentored junior developers.
  \end{tightitemize}
\end{cventry}

\subsection{Government Digital Service}

\begin{cventry}{\range{Jun~2019}{Feb~2022}}{Senior Developer}
  \begin{tightitemize}
  \item Led a small multidisciplinary agile team doing discovery into an account system for GOV.UK.
  \item Prototyped and then productionised a machine learning pipeline for search result ranking using Amazon SageMaker.
  \item Led an upgrade from Elasticsearch 5 to Elasticsearch 6.
  \item Worked with external pentesters, providing assistance and triage.
  \item Worked with performance analysts to plan and implement A/B tests.
  \end{tightitemize}
\end{cventry}

\begin{cventry}{\range{Apr~2018}{Jun~2019}}{Developer}
  \begin{tightitemize}
  \item Made various improvements to the GOV.UK stack: for performance, technical debt, and architecture debt.  Mostly Ruby and Rails or Sinatra, some Python, various types of database (e.g. PostgreSQL and MySQL).  All running on Linux.
  \item Led initial experiments into load testing.
  \item Planned and implemented an upgrade from Elasticsearch 2 to Elasticsearch 5.
  \item Worked with AWS infrastructure using Terraform and Puppet.
  \item Gave regular support to teams which did not merit a full-time developer.

\end{cventry}

\section{Education}

\subsection{University of York}

\begin{cventry}{\range{2014}{2019}}{Ph.D in Computer Science}
  My thesis ``Revealing Behaviours of Concurrent Functional Programs
  by Systematic Testing'' examined the deterministic testing of
  concurrent programs with shared memory and message passing.
  Supervised by Colin Runciman, and examined by Simon Peyton Jones and
  Ana Cavalcanti.
\end{cventry}

\begin{cventry}{\range{2010}{2014}}{M.Eng in Computer Systems and Software Engineering}
  My dissertation on the formal verification of stop-the-world garbage
  collectors received first-class honours.  Overall, I achieved a 2:1.
